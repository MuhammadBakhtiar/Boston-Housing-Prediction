## 📌 Overview

This project builds a predictive model to estimate house prices in Boston based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. The dataset is from the Boston Housing Dataset.

## 🚀 Models Used

1. **Linear Regression** (Baseline model)
2. **Random Forest Regression** (Improved accuracy)

## 🔍 Performance Metrics (Random Forest)

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 2.03
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** 7.83
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 2.80
- **R² Score:** 0.8932 (\~89% accuracy)

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Scatter Plot with Regression Line** → Shows actual vs. predicted house prices.

## 🛠️ Installation & Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Boston-Housing-Prediction.git
cd Boston-Housing-Prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## 📎 Dataset

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset).

## 📌 Next Steps

- Try advanced models like **XGBoost** for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit.
